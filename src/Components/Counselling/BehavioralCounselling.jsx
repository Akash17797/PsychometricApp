                    Behavioral counselling is an umbrella term for types of therapy that treat mental health disorders. It is based on the idea that all behaviors are learned and that behavior can be changed. This form of counselling seeks to identify and help change potentially self-destructive and unhealthy behaviors. The focus of treatment therapy is often on current problems and how to change them.
