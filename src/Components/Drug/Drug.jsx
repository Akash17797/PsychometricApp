          Drug abuse prevention is a multifaceted endeavor aimed at reducing the misuse of substances and promoting healthier lifestyles. At its core, drug abuse prevention seeks to address the root causes and risk factors associated with substance abuse while promoting protective factors that foster resilience and well-being. This comprehensive approach involves various strategies, interventions, and community efforts to mitigate the impact of drug abuse on individuals, families, and communities.

          Education plays a pivotal role in drug abuse prevention by raising awareness about the risks and consequences of substance abuse. Schools, families, and communities often collaborate to provide evidence-based drug education programs that equip individuals with the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions and resist peer pressure. These programs typically cover topics such as the effects of drugs on the body and mind, refusal skills, coping mechanisms, and healthy alternatives to substance use.
